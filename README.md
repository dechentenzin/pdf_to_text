Convert a folder full of PDFs into Text files 


This is something I coded based on resources available on the web. I wanted to figure out a way to convert PDFs into text format. 

There are two types of PDFs out there, from what I know. You have your regular "binary" PDFs which are text files such as Word doc that were save as PDFs. These are easy to convert into text. 

The more challenging PDFs are the ones that are scanned "images". So for example, a document that was printed then later scanned. Now, converting these images into text require learning about "OCR" (Optical Character Recognition).
